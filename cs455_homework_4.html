	CS 455 homework #4 - data classification
</h1>

<h2> Notes: <br />
	<ul>
     <li> 150 points. </li>
     <li> Due by 11:59 PM, Thursday, 04/11/2024. </li>
     <li> Work individually or as a group. </li>
     <li> Accuracy values must be reported using percentages (%). </li>
	</ul>
</h2>
<hr />
<ul><b>Data preparation</b>

     <li> Add a new column as class label to the dataset used in homework 3. 
          Use two labels only, with 50 data objects for each label. <br />
          I used A and B in this document as an example.<br />
          Suggestions: <br />
          You can use other non-used attributes to decide the labels.
          Or use your own judgement to do so. 
     </li>  
     <br />
     <li> Assign 50 data objects (25 As and 25 Bs) as Training Data, used for constructing the classifier. <br /> 
          Use the rest 50 data objects as Test Data, used for predicting class labels.
     </li>
</ul>

<br />
<ul> <b>KNN Classification</b> 
  <li> Implement KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) data classification on your own or use KNN from  scikit-learn. <br />
       Demonstrate two K values, i.e., K = 1 and K = 7.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li> Compare the predicted labels against true labels to generate/display the accuracy. 
  </li>   

</ul>

<br />
<ul> <b> Decision Tree Classification </b>



  <li> Train the decision tree using our Training Data (50; 25As and 25Bs) </li>

  <li> Use the Test Data to test the performance. That is, compare the predicted labels against true labels and compute the accuracy. 
  </li>
</ul>

<br />
  <li> What to turn in?
       <ul>
            <li> (20 points) The dataset used (101 rows; header + data), with two normalized columns (integers with [0..100]) and one class label column(two classes). <br />
                 Name the dataset as cs455_homework_4_lastname_dataset.csv </li>
            <br />
            <li> (40 points) Program source code, cs455_homework_4_lastname_program.ipynb. <br />
                 The program must clearly indicate how/where accuracy values of Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3, been calculated. <br />
                 The program should not contain anything unnecessary, e.g., testing, trial-and-error, ...</li>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li> A report, i.e. cs455_homework_4_lastname_report.pdf, including
